# Work Log with a Database

This program allows user to create, view, edit, and delete timesheet entries.

The user can search by employee, entry date, a range of dates, the minutes spent on the assignment, or the user can enter a query that the program will search for in the task name and the notes of entries.

If running `app.py` directly, if `testing` is set to `True` in `app.py` and the database is empty, it will be populated with dummy data found in `testdata.py`.
